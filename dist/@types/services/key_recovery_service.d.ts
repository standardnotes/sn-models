     * Ignored items keys are items keys which arrived from a remote source, which we were

     * properly decrypted. Since items keys key contents are immutable, if we already have a
     * successfully decrypted version, yet we can't decrypt the new version, we should should
     * temporarily ignore the new version until we can properly decrypt it (through the recovery flow),
     * and not overwrite the local copy.
     *
     * Ignored items are persisted to disk in isolated storage so that they may be decrypted
     * whenever. When they are finally decryptable, we will emit them and update our database
     * with the new decrypted value.
     *
     * When the app first launches, we will query the isolated storage to see if there are any
     * keys we need to decrypt.
