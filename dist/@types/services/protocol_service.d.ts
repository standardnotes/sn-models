/**
 * The protocol service is responsible for the encryption and decryption of payloads, and
 * handles delegation of a task to the respective protocol operator. Each version of the protocol
 * (001, 002, 003, 004, etc) uses a respective operator version to perform encryption operations.
 * Operators are located in /protocol/operator.
 * The protocol service depends on the keyManager for determining which key to use for the
 * encryption and decryption of a particular payload.
 * The protocol service is also responsible for dictating which protocol versions are valid,
 * and which are no longer valid or not supported.

 * The key manager is responsible for managing root key and root key wrapper states.
 * When the key manager is initialized, it initiates itself with a keyMode, which
 * dictates the entire flow of key management. The key manager's responsibilities include:
 * - interacting with the device keychain to save or clear the root key
 * - interacting with storage to save root key params or wrapper params, or the wrapped root key.
 * - exposing methods that allow the application to unwrap the root key (unlock the application)
 *
 * It also exposes two primary methods for determining what key should be used to encrypt
 * or decrypt a particular payload. Some payloads are encrypted directly with the rootKey
 * (such as itemsKeys and encryptedStorage). Others are encrypted with itemsKeys (notes, tags, etc).

 * The items key manager manages the lifecycle of items keys.
 * It is responsible for creating the default items key when conditions call for it
 * (such as after the first sync completes and no key exists).
 * It also exposes public methods that allows consumers to retrieve an items key
 * for a particular payload, and also retrieve all available items keys.
