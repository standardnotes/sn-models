/**
 * The Actions Service allows clients to interact with action-based extensions.
 * Action-based extensions are mostly RESTful actions that can push a local value or
 * retrieve a remote value and act on it accordingly.
 * There are 4 action types:
 * `get`: performs a GET request on an endpoint to retrieve an item value, and merges the
 *      value onto the local item value. For example, you can GET an item's older revision
 *      value and replace the current value with the revision.
 * `render`: performs a GET request, and displays the result in the UI. This action does not
 *         affect data unless action is taken explicitely in the UI after the data is presented.
 * `show`: opens the action's URL in a browser.
 * `post`: sends an item's data to a remote service. This is used for example by Listed
 *       to allow publishing a note to a user's blog.
