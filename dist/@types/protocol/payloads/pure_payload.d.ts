/**
 * A payload is a vehicle in which item data is transported or persisted.
 * This class represents an abstract PurePayload which does not have any fields. Instead,
 * subclasses must override the `fields` static method to return which fields this particular
 * class of payload contains. For example, a ServerItemPayload is a transmission vehicle for
 * transporting an item to the server, and does not contain fields like PayloadFields.Dirty.
 * However, a StorageItemPayload is a persistence vehicle for saving payloads to disk, and does contain
 * PayloadsFields.Dirty.
 *
 * Payloads are completely immutable and may not be modified after creation. Payloads should
 * not be created directly using the constructor, but instead created using the generators avaiable
 * in generator.js.
 *
 * Payloads also have a content format. Formats can either be
 * DecryptedBase64String, EncryptedString, or DecryptedBareObject.
